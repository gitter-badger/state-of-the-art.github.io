excerpt: State Of The Art is a community of free creators

Hello stranger, since you find this site I want to tell you a little about this project.

In a few words: **State Of The Art project is created to change the IT world.**

I'm trying to explain this in a number of blog posts, you can [see them here](/blog/).

But overall let's check how it will go - we have a number of interesting projects, like:
* 3D Scanner - for the future AR/VR instagram
* Peer-to-Peer Social Network application - to make sure your info will be yours
* Guitarists software - to compete GuitarPro
* Car multimedia and control system
* ... and so many others

And we want to test our philosophy using this project, prepare new rules, automate it and
finally make sure - everyone can do something useful & can realize themself as the real
creators.

This project is mostly opensource and we spending all the money to pay our developers, so
it will be nice if you can buy our software or use donate buttons to support us.

Thank you!
