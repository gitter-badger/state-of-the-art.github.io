## Description

Opensource general-purpose portable 3D scanner application.

## Requirements

* Host:
  * **Smartphone / Tablet** - anything with Android 5+ (Lollipop or better) and usb2/3 host is ok
  * **Linux workstation** - Ubuntu LTS, Debian, CentOS...
* **Intel Realsense D400** - stereo camera with D4 board (tested D415 and D435i)
* **USB-C/USB-C cable** - USB3.1 Gen 1 and USB2 will work properly
* **Handy 3D Scanner** - application piece, published in Android store and available for workstations.

## Price

* Professional 3d scanners: ~$10'000-$20'000.
* Table laser scanners: ~$70-$500.

With Intel Realsense D415 (~$140) and mobile app you can get a simple solution with the next parameters:
* Resolution: 1Mpix (1280x720)
* Frame-rate: 30-60 fps
* Angle: 63째x40째, 85째x58째
* Range: .16-10m, .11-10m

## Application

### Overview

Basically have just 3 main functions:
* **Capture** - allow to get shots and records of the environment
  * General mode -
    you can take pointclouds capturing your surrounding with a proper positioning of the
    shots (gyroscope or arcore positioning).
  * Record mode (*in dev*) -
    Useful for experimenting with AI, but consumes alot of memory
* **View/Edit** - shows what `pc` you have and allow to edit them
  * List of the captured `pc`
  * Show/Hide `pc` from the list
  * Camera controls: rotation, zoom, focus to point
  * Selection of `pc` points: single, line, box
  * Hide points: selected or unselected
  * Delete points: selected or unselected
* **Load/Save** - when we would like to view or store `pc` or mesh
* **Export** - save the whole 3d scene as glTF 2.0 glb file to import it in 3d edit software or share

Also there will be settings, skeletal animation and other stuff.

### Applications

* VR/AR avatars,  objects - scan yourself, your cat or entire house and bring them to VR/AR.
* General purpose portable 3d scanner for 3d printer - if you want to build a copy of object you like.
* Modelling - sometimes it's much easier to scan and edit in 3d editor (Blender / 3DSMax).
* Measuring - it's pretty accurate, so you can use it to measure stuff or proportions.
* 3d Instagram - hopefully we will get to this state :)
* Who knows - when such techs are going wild, it's hard to predict how they will be used.

### Features

* Easy capture from Intel Realsense D415/D435
* Full available camera resolution (D415 1280x720 points)
* Preview of the captured point clouds (pc)
* Save captured pc in PCD format and export scene to glTF 2
* Simple pc edit tools
* Gyro-based panoramic shots

### Plans

You can see all the feature requests/bugs on the github page:

* [Milestones](https://github.com/state-of-the-art/Handy3DScanner/milestones)
* [Issues](https://github.com/state-of-the-art/Handy3DScanner/issues)

But overall we have a huge plans to make this application better!
* **Prepare version 1.0** - it should be useful for everyday use.
* **Kickstarter campagin** - customers want to see the complete product - so why not?
* **Publish source code** - necessary to make sure the project will live it's long life.
* **Reach the top** - the market could be bigger, any smartphone should get this feature
  because AR/VR is coming. So Handy 3D Scanner can help with building the new future where
  everyone will take not just photo, but capture part of the 3d world and place it in VR.

### OpenSource

This is an experimental project - main goal is to test State Of The Art philosophy on practice.

We would like to see a number of independent developers working on the same project issues
for the real money (attached to the ticket) or just for fun. So let's see how this will work.

#### License

Repository and it's content is covered by `Apache v2.0` - so anyone can use it without any concerns.

If you will have some time - it will be great to see your changes merged to the original repository -
but it's your choise, no pressure.

#### Build

You can find application sources in the [GitHub](https://github.com/state-of-the-art/Handy3DScanner/)
repository and build your own binaries for workstation/android devices following the README.md
build steps.

## Privacy policy

It's very important to save user private data and you can be sure: we working on security
of our applications and improving it every day. No data could be sent somewhere without
